Welcome to the [Voice Assistant Standardisation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/voice-assistant/)!

## Problem Statment

> Hey Alexa, Bixby, Cortana, Google, Siri, etc,

> How can I write a voice skill which works across all of you?

> "I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question."

* As a product owner, I want to be able to write a service that is compatible across multiple voice assistant platforms.
* As a developer, I want to create and maintain a single code-base for an app that is compatible across multiple voice assistant platforms
* As a Government department, we need to offer access to our voice services across all platforms.

## Evidence of user need
The UK's Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency released [a Skill for Amazon's Alexa](https://dvladigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/27/weve-updated-our-vehicle-enquiry-alexa-skill-on-amazon/)

If you read the comments on that page from members of the public, you will see that people want the skill to be available on their voice assistant of choice.

The cost to develop a skill for multiple competing voice platforms is prohibitive for many developers.
